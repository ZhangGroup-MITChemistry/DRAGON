## Process Epigenomics Data 

DRAGON connects the sequence of the chromatin to its structure to predict chromatin folding starting from epigenomics data. The genome-wide histone modification and CTCF binding profiles available at [ENCODE](https://www.encodeproject.org), however, needs to be preprocessed into formats recognized by DRAGON. In particular, different histone modifications must be combined together to define chromatin states, and the orientation of each CTCF binding site needs to be identified. Please refer to the README in each folder for more details on data processing.
